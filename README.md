This repo contains road maps and study material for learning AI


## Big Picture of AI road map
1. Learning mathematical oncepts from following math domain
   - [Linear Algebra](Linear-Algebra/linear-algebra-resources.md)
   - [Calculus](calculus/calculus-resources.md)
   - [Statistics](Statistics/statics-resources.md)

2. Get comfortble in python basic library
    - Numpy, Pandas
    - Matplotlib, Seaborn
    - Scikit-learn

    Note: [we can follow google's python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)

    Practice with small projects like 
    - Titanic survival prediction (Kaggle)
    - Predicting house prices

3. Understand basic AI/ML concepts
   - [General Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/home/week/1)
   - [Kaggle micro-courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)

4. Dive into machine learning
   ### Topic Outline
       - Linear & Logistic Regression
       - Decision Trees, Random Forests
       - KNN, SVM
       - Naive Bayes
       - Model Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC)

   ### Tools 
       - Scikit-learn (for most models)
       - Jupyter Notebook (to code interactively)


   ### Practice projects
       - Spam classifier
       - Credit card fraud detection
       - Image classification (basic)


5. Dive into deep learning (Neural networks)
   ### Topic Outline

       - Perceptron, Feedforward Neural Networks
       - Activation functions
       - Backpropagation
       - CNNs (for image), RNNs (for sequences)
       - Transformers (for NLP)

   ### Topic Outline
       - TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose one to start)
       - Keras (high-level wrapper for TensorFlow)
   ### Resource
   - [Coursera Deep Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
   - [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)

6. Computer Vision: OpenCV, CNNs
