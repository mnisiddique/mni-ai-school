## What to learn in calculus in basic level?

1. Limits & continuity

2. Derivatives

3. Chain rule

4. Product/quotient rule

5. Integrals (basic understanding)

## Where to learn
   - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1)
   - [Paul's math](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)

## What to learn in calculus in advance level?

1. Partial derivatives

2. Gradients    

3. Jacobians

4. Hessians    

5. Directional derivatives    

## Where to learn
   [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
   [MIT Open course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)


## What to learn in optimization technique
1. Gradient descent

2. Constrained optimization (Lagrange multipliers)

3. Convex functions

## Where to learn

 - [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
 - Book: Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow (Chapter 4 is great for math)

## Connect to Machine Learning
   - After the math, see it in action:
   - Understand how derivatives apply to backpropagation
   - Study how calculus influences loss landscapes
   - Implement gradient descent from scratch in Python

## Resources:
  - [Calculus for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8)
  - Python libraries: NumPy, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (learn how auto-grad works)


## Tips for Studying
  - Practice problems by hand before using code
  - Try visual tools (Desmos, GeoGebra)
  - Recreate training steps manually (e.g., linear regression via gradient descent)
